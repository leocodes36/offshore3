# Offshore Wind Energy course: Student code (with FIXMEs)

## What?

This is the code for Assignment 3 of the Offshore Wind Energy course. This is the code that you need to run and correct according to the ```FIXME``` tags that are inserted in the code.

## Why?

Nobody's perfect - I want to be able to make changes and push them to you.

## How?

Install git.
Open a terminal. Run:
```
git clone git@gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk:owe-course/assignment3.git
```

## When?

I'll let you know when bugs have been corrected. 
However, you can just pull now and then to make sure you have the latest changes.

Happy coding!
